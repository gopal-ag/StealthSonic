# The Problem: 
The unfenced border regions in India present a significant challenge to national security and border control efforts. These areas, often characterized by rugged terrain, dense vegetation, and difficult geographical conditions, provide potential opportunities for illegal crossings, smuggling, and other security threats. The lack of physical barriers makes it harder to monitor and regulate border movements effectively. To address this problem, there is a pressing need for an advanced border security system that can overcome the limitations of traditional fences

# Our Inovation: The StealthSonic
SonicShield is an advanced border security system that revolutionizes the way borders are monitored and protected. By harnessing the power of ultrasonic sensors, SonicShield provides a non-intrusive and highly effective solution for detecting and preventing unauthorized border crossings using AI and IoT systems.
